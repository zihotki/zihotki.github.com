Today is the day when I finally started blogging. I've been thinking about starting a blog for very long time, 
but due to the laziness I have never started one. Today I woke up and made a final decision - now or newer! And here it is.

I have many interests and enjoy writing software. And when you enjoy something, it's normal to get some ideas
about various aspects, which could lead to some potential OSS projects, or which can be useful for others. And blog is a great place
to share such ideas. So I'll try my best and let's see where it will lead me :)
